1) I enjoyed this homework and thought it was fun. It was not very difficult and I didn't run into many problems. 

2) As usual, I used stackoverflow for many questions I had.

3) It just seems a bit archaic to use NSImage and NSRect for drawing and animating things, esp when Adobe, Maya, etc, 
have so many useful and more powerful tools. I wonder if the high end graphics seen in games today use 3rd party 
plugins to do graphic design? Or is it all natively designed in Apple code?
